# Sales & Customer Performance Analysis Dashboard | Tableau

## Project Overview
This project involves building a **dual-dashboard Tableau** visualization for analyzing and visualizing sales and customer data, providing actionable insights into **sales growth**, **profit margins**, and **regional performance**. The dashboards utilize **KPIs**, **geographic maps**, and **time-series visualizations** to empower data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Dual-Dashboard Design**: The project features two interactive dashboards:
  - **Sales Dashboard**: Displays key metrics related to sales performance.
  - **Customer Dashboard**: Provides insights into customer segments and state-by-state performance.
- **Interactive KPIs**: The dashboards track **20.4% Year-over-Year (YoY) sales growth** and **14.2% profit growth**, allowing users to monitor performance at a glance.
- **Geographic Maps**: Visualizes sales and profit distribution across different regions, helping to identify top-performing states and areas with potential for growth.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Offers users the ability to filter data by customer segments and state-level performance, enabling granular analysis.

## Key Insights & Analysis
- **Overall Sales & Profit Growth**: The dashboard reveals a **20.4% sales growth** and **14.2% profit growth** YoY, highlighting a positive trend in sales performance and overall profitability.
- **Regional Sales Distribution**: Geographic maps provide a visual representation of how sales and profits are distributed across regions, helping businesses identify regions for expansion or focus.
- **Customer Segments**: Analysis of customer segments highlights the categories driving growth, while also revealing opportunities for improvement in underperforming segments.
- **Time-Series Insights**: Time-series visualizations track the evolution of sales and profits, offering insights into trends, seasonality, and potential areas for boosting sales during peak periods.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization and creating the interactive dashboards. Tableau's capabilities allowed for the seamless integration of KPIs and geographic maps.
- **SQL**: Used for data extraction and aggregation, enabling efficient queries to process the large dataset required for meaningful insights.
